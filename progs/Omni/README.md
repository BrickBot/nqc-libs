RCX-Omni is a program for the original RCX (1.0) which was written for CSCI 172 at Western Washington University in Spring quarter of 2010.

It works around RCX limitations primarily using a lookup table for trig, as RCX 1.0 did not support trig or floats.

To replicate the hardware setup, see the images robot.jpg, wheel.jpg and remote.jpg. Details:
- Three motor outputs on an equilateral triangle frame. See robot.jpg.
- Each motor output should have an omniwheel or Lego Omniwheel. My design for this wheel is attached as Wheel.jpg.
- Robot is controlled with a rotation sensor on Sensor 1, a "reset bearing" button on sensor 2, and a "go" button on sensor 3.
- I don't have any documentation on which output goes to which motor...
